/**
 * This class represents a filter to group a collection of Cards
 * by various characteristics.  Each filter has a String representation
 * and can parse a String for its values.  The overall filter is
 * represented by a tree whose internal nodes are groups and whose leaf
 * nodes filter out characteristics.  A filter can test if a Card matches
 * its characteristics.
 *
 * Note that because filters are mutable, they do not make good keys or Set
 * members.
